JTextParser
==============

Contains 2 major components:
1. textParser - a set of interfaces and implementation classes for reading a stream of input text lines using conditional methods like nextIf() and nextIfNot().
2. parserUtils - static utility functions to complement textParser, some functions parse directly from line buffers, others can parse from strings.
